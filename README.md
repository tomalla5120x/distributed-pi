# distributed-pi

Repository for the collaborative uni assigment. The task was to use UDP as means of conducting and managing computations distributed among many computers across the network. The overall computation task tackled here is computing the decimal expansion of Ï€ as a Monte Carlo experiment, where workers are randomly generating points on a unit square and counting up the ones that wound up in a unit circle.

The assigment has already finished and the repository is now archived.
